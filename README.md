Through thisproject I have learnt and demonstrated the use of libraries like Matplotlib,Seaborn,Jupyterthemes,Scikit-Learn for data Visualization.
The graphs build in this project are
** Line Charts
**Scattered Plots
** Pie Charts
** Histograms
** Heat Maps

This is a project with hands on data from Coursera and Sk-Learn Breast Cancer Data .
This project has enabled me to decide which type of visualization should be used for various scenarios and would help in future upcomming projects.
